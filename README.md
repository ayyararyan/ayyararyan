- 👋 Hi, I’m @ayyararyan
<p align="justify">
👀 I’m interested in ...
- I have developed a profound interest in data driven risk management and aim to leverage
data (we can rephrase this as “New Gold”) in making investors aware of existing market
inefficiencies , simultaneously assessing psychological phenomenon affecting their decision-
making processes. I believe that investor rationality plays a crucial role in the context of risk
perception. In a technically nuanced perspective, rational investors must assess the trade-off
between risk and return keeping in mind the premise that markets are inherently uncertain.
Risk Management, akin to navigating a delicate tightrope, presents both formidable
complexity and immense rewards. This is something I would love to explore further.
